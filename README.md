Soooooooooooo, this is a project that a friend of mine recommended to work in to test my abilities.
It is a project based on florinpop17 repositorie, https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/2-Intermediate/Password-Generator.md
It is still on work, I need to get the strength part done.
It is just to show a little bit of what I know at react/javascript.
I know is not perfect so I'm open to suggestions on how to improve my work.
